<p>
    Hi! my name is Facundo and I'm an argentinian 17-year-old guy who is starting his programming career. I'm a Coderhouse student learning about Python and Django, essential tools for functional web-sites like this digital library.
</p>
<p>
    I've always been really into music, but I'm currently looking for new passions related to technology in order to work my way up to creating attractive useful web-pages.
